This Anki addon has been a one-man project for a long time.
There isn't much documentation of the code.

As I have stopped developping the addon for a long time,
I kind of forgot the finer details of some parts of the code.
I believe that entire files are unneccessary, and I will polish
teh code accordingly when I have the time.

There is however comprehensive user documentation in the
